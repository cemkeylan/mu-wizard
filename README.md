mu-wizard
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shell script to auto-configure email accounts for `mu4e` similar in function to
mutt-wizard. It uses `isync` to synchronize mail accounts, `msmtp` to send mail
and creates individual Lisp profiles for each account. It is still WIP.


Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* `isync` (for offline mail storage)
* `mu` (or maildir-utils depending on your distribution)
* `msmtp` (for sending mails)
* Password manager (`pass`, `pash`, and `pm` is supported)


Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to install mu-wizard, clone this repository and build mu-wizard.

    git clone https://github.com/cemkeylan/mu-wizard.git
    cd mu-wizard
    make install

Users of Arch Linux based distributions can install mu-wizard through the AUR
package [mu-wizard-git]

    yay -S mu-wizard-git


Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The wizard is called by running `muw`. The options below are available for usage
with it.

    muw a: Add and autoconfigure an email address
    muw d: Pick an account to delete
    muw l: List configured accounts
    muw p: Purge all configuration
    muw s: See your share directory


Emacs Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Emacs will not be loading the configurations, you will need to set it manually.
In your init file, you may choose to load the configuration in the following
ways.

``` elisp
(load-file "~/.config/mu4e/mu4e-config.el")
```

``` elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.config/mu4e")
(require 'mu4e-config)
```

``` elisp
(use-package mu4e-config
  :after mu4e
  :load-path "~/.config/mu4e")
```


`Domains.csv` file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`mu-wizard` doesn't come with a predefined `domains.csv` file, but it can use
one if it is found on `/usr/share/mu-wizard/domains.csv`. `mu-wizard` also saves
the domain information that you use when creating an account on your
configuration directory, so you don't have to retype every detail when creating
a second account with the same domain.


Overrides
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Domain-level overrides are possible by adding a shell file to either the share
directory (`/usr/local/share/mu-wizard/overrides`) or the user configuration
directory (`~/.config/mu4e/overrides`). See `overrides/protonmail.com` for an
example override. You can run `muw share` to learn your share directory.


### Protonmail users

`mu-wizard` supports protonmail. If you are using one of the default domains,
you don't have to do anything. If you are an alternative domain, you can link
the protonmail.com override to your personal domain. Here is an example:

``` sh
ln -sf /usr/share/mu-wizard/overrides/protonmail.com $HOME/.config/mu4e/overrides/example.com
```
